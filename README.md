DeepLearning

## Project Overview

Helping Backs who is a datascientist in the nonprofit foundation Alphabet Soup to predict which organizations are worth donating to and which are too high risk. I designed a neural network, or deep learning model, using the python TensorFlow library to create a binary classification model that can predict if an Alphabet Soup–funded organization will be successful based on the features in the dataset. Then, I compileed, trained, and evaluateed the binary classification model to calculate the model’s loss and accuracy.
