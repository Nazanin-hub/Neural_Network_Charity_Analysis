# Neural_Network_Charity_Analysis
DeepLearning

## Project Overview

Helping Backs who is a datascientist in the nonprofit foundation Alphabet Soup to predict which organizations are worth donating to and which are too high risk. I designed a neural network, or deep learning model, using the python TensorFlow library to create a binary classification model that can predict if an Alphabet Soup–funded organization will be successful based on the features in the dataset. Then, I compileed, trained, and evaluateed the binary classification model to calculate the model’s loss and accuracy.


## Resources

Data Source: charity_data.csv

Software: Python 3.8.3, Anaconda Navigator 1.9.12, Jupyter Notebook 6.0.3


## Results

### Data Preprocessing

  - IS_SUCCESSFUL column has been considered the target for the model.
  
  - All columns(APPLICATION_TYPE, AFFILIATION, CLASSIFICATION, USE_CASE, ORGANIZATION, STATUS, INCOME_AMT, SPECIAL_CONSIDERATIONS, ASK_AMT ) except IS_SUCCESSFUL column haave been considered the features for the model.
  
  - Identification columns,'EIN','NAME', should be removed from the input data.
